    Comprehensive API documentation for the SchoolERP platform.
    This API handles everything from student management, finance, and exams
    to AI-powered parent helpdesks and cross-campus analytics.

    ### Authentication
    Most endpoints require a signed JWT token in the `Authorization` header:
    `Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>`

    ### Multi-tenancy
    The API supports multi-tenancy. You must specify the tenant ID in the
    `X-Tenant-ID` header or ensure the request is routed via the tenant's subdomain.

    ### Response Formats
    All responses are in JSON format and follow a consistent structure:
    - Success: `{ "success": true, "data": { ... } }`
    - Error: `{ "success": false, "message": "error description", "code": "ERR_CODE" }`
