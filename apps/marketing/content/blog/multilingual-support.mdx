# Why Multi-language support is critical for Indian Schools

In India, education is often delivered in regional languages. While many ERPs focus only on English, true accessibility means providing:
- **UI in regional languages** for parents and support staff.
- **Multilingual PDFs** for receipts and report cards.
- **Localized terminology** that matches local board standards.

Our platform is designed from the ground up to solve this.
